# compactness ratio: 
# Circles: For a perfect circle, the ratio of area to perimeter (compactness) is maximized, because circles have the highest area for a given perimeter compared to other shapes. This makes the compactness ratio close to that of a circle.
# Rectangles and Other Polygons: Shapes like rectangles, especially elongated ones, have a lower compactness ratio compared to circles. This is because they have more perimeter for the same area compared to a circle.
